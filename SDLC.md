1. Requirements Gathering
Sat with Roshan, Jhansi, and Kushal to understand the real business pain points and user needs for Rules Studio. Learned why such a system was critical for automating cheque duplication checks and what features were needed to empower internal users.

2. Building Initial UI Pages
Designed and developed the basic user interface using React, focusing on usability and a clean, intuitive layout. Created the dashboard structure, navigation, and placeholders for rule creation and management, keeping the end-user in mind from the start.

3. Dummy API Integration for Testing
Implemented dummy API endpoints to simulate backend responses. This allowed for early UI testing, ensured data flows worked as intended, and provided a solid base to demo features to stakeholders before building the actual backend.

4. Managing Fetched Data with Redux State Management
Integrated Redux for robust state management. Handled fetching, storing, and updating rule data, user info, and role permissions. Solved several state update bugs, ensuring UI always reflected the latest data and user actions.

5. Building Real Backend Services
Developed actual backend services using Node.js and SQLite3 for data storage. Implemented JWT authentication, authorization middleware, and rule engine logic. Switched from H2 to SQLite3 for seamless integration with Node.js.

6. Refactoring of Backend & Improving UX
Refactored backend code for better modularity and maintainability. Simultaneously improved user experience by optimizing API responses, speeding up load times, and refining UI elements based on user feedback and internal testing.

7. Testing and Code Improvements
Conducted thorough manual and automated testing across all modules. Fixed critical bugs, enhanced security, and iterated on both UI and backend logic for greater reliability. Ensured the product was stable, scalable, and ready for stakeholder demos and deployment.
