4. LIVE Demo [5 min walk-through]
Walk through the application from login to workflow status update.

Show role-based UI, demonstrate form creation/editing, and highlight unique features like resizable tables and tooltips.

Share screen (or video) to demonstrate real-time usage.

5. Major Learnings & Growth
5.1 Technical Growth

Frontend:

Mastered Redux, custom component building (resizable tables, tooltips, Toastify, accordion).

Learned about pagination (client-side and theory for server-side).

Gained deep understanding of TanStack Query, and core concepts in package.json and build tools.

Backend:

Built scalable APIs with JsonServer, integrated SQLite3, and handled authentication/authorization.

Designed a modular backend (models, routes, controllers).

Why SQLite3? Lightweight, zero-config, ideal for quick prototyping and testing.

Version Control:

Maintained clean codebase using Git; visualized history with a Git graph for better team collaboration.

Automation (Jenkins):

Automated builds and tests with CI/CD pipelines.

Scheduled automated tasks and learned to run periodic jobs.

5.2 Professional Growth

Sharpened communication and teamwork by collaborating across roles and geographies.

Developed resilience and problem-solving mindset (handling bugs, adapting to new tech).

Reinforced the value of open feedback and proactive learning.

Personal Note:

Reiterate gratitude for team support, especially during challenging family times (mention support during mother’s injury).

Acknowledge openness and mentorship from the team.

6. Further Improvements & Future Roadmap
Column-based filters for improved data exploration.

Completing the “Simulate” function (mail services with node-mailer).

Upgrade to server-side pagination for scalability.

7. Brand Building & Key Takeaways (Sticky Note)
Desires: What do I want to build/solve?

Abilities: What are my strengths (technical/professional)?

Temperament: How do I approach problems & work in teams?

Assets: What unique value do I bring to the table?

8. Closing & Thank You
Final reflection:

"This internship was more than a technical journey—it was about becoming a more complete, resilient, and empathetic professional."

Special thanks:

Team, mentors, and especially the support received during personal challenges.

End with Jamie Dimon's quote:
"Return every email and phone call – every day. Run efficient meetings – start on time and have an agenda and a follow up list."

Thank the audience for their time and support.
